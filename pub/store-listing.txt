This app adds Kamloops Transit System (BC Transit) buses information to MonTransit.

This app provides the buses schedule and news from YouTube and @BCTransit on Twitter.

Kamloops Transit System buses serve Kamloops in British Columbia, Canada.

Once this application is installed, the MonTransit app will display buses information (schedule...).

This application only has a temporary icon and no screen: download the MonTransit app (free) in the "More ..." section bellow or by following this Google Play link http://goo.gl/pCk5mV

You can install this application on the SD card but it is not recommended.

The information comes from the GTFS file provided by BC Transit.
